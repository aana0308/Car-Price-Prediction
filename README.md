# Car-Price-Prediction
ML Lab Exercise 2

# Problem Statement
A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts.

They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. The company wants to know:

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car
2. How well those variables describe the price of a car

# Dataset
The dataset used is the Car Price Prediciton dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction/download) from Kaggle. Regression Analysis will be used for the task.

**Target Variable:** Car Price

Car Price refers to the
<br>
**Mean Car price:**
<br>
**Max Car price:**
<br>
**Min Car price:**

# Model Used
The model used is **Multiple Linear Regression**.
<br>
<br>
When one variable/column in a dataset is not sufficient to create a good model and make more accurate predictions, we’ll use a multiple linear regression model instead of a simple linear regression model.
The line equation for the multiple linear regression model is:
<br>
**y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + β3X3 + .... + βpXp + e**
<br>
<br>
Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) Each feature variable must model the linear relationship with the dependent variable.is one of the important regression algorithms which models the linear relationship between a single dependent continuous variable and more than one independent variable.
<br><br>
For MLR, the dependent or target variable(Y) must be the continuous/real, but the predictor or independent variable may be of continuous or categorical form. MLR tries to fit a regression line through a multidimensional space of data-points.
